# 🌲 **RedBlack Defense** 🌟  

Welcome to **RedBlack Defense**, a unique blend of serious learning and strategic gameplay! This project was created during the **Game Programming course (CO3045)** by me and a fellow student. While I handled all aspects of **game development**, my friend contributed by sourcing materials and documentation.

## 🕹️ **About the Game**

**RedBlack Defense** combines the thrill of a **tower defense game** with the logic and beauty of the **Red-Black Tree data structure**.  

### 🎮 **Gameplay Features**  
- **Simulation Mode**:  
  - Visualize the process of **inserting** and **removing nodes** in a Red-Black Tree.  
  - Observe the **rotations** and balancing mechanisms in real-time.  

- **Tower Defense Mode**:  
  - Each tower has a **value**, forming valid Red-Black Tree(s) is the key to success.  
  - The **larger** the tree, the **stronger** every tower within it becomes.  
  - Strategize! Building **one large tree** maximizes power but is more challenging than smaller trees.
